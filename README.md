# Business problem
It's required to create a reservation REST API for ASHIR Hotel , the Api should allow customers to look for and to book room in the hotel. In addition, it must allow them to customer register in the hotel database. 

The System will have several entities, room, customer and reservation

A room is defined by:
- number
- room type
- base price

A reservation is definerd by:
- reserve date
- room
- customer
- reserve code
- total value

A customer is defined by:
- first name
- last name
- id card number
- address
- age
- e-mail

REST API allows performing the next functionalities

1. A customer can register in the hotel database, in this ENDPOINT it is validated that the id card number is an integer, and the first and last name contain data, and these canÂ´t be null.

POST Method, request customer ENDPOINT example (http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customer ) [POST]
